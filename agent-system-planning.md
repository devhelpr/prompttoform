# Plan for Agent System Integration

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, here's a comprehensive plan for extending the initial prompt page with an agent system that can analyze prompts and ask clarifying questions when needed.

## Overview

The agent system will be integrated into the existing `apps/prompttoform` project and will work alongside the current form generation process. The system will:

1. **Analyze user prompts** to determine if they contain sufficient information
2. **Generate clarifying questions** when information is missing
3. **Manage conversation flow** between user and agent
4. **Delegate to form generation** when sufficient information is gathered
5. **Maintain conversation context** throughout the process

## Architecture

### 1. Agent System Components

**Core Services:**
- `PromptAnalysisAgent` - Analyzes prompts for completeness
- `QuestionGenerationAgent` - Generates clarifying questions
- `ConversationManager` - Manages conversation flow and state
- `FormGenerationAgent` - Handles the actual form generation task

**UI Components:**
- `AgentConversation` - Main conversation interface
- `QuestionCard` - Individual question display
- `ConversationHistory` - Shows conversation timeline
- `AgentPromptInput` - Enhanced prompt input with agent integration

### 2. Integration Points

The agent system will integrate with existing components:
- **InitialPromptInput** - Enhanced with agent conversation flow
- **FormGenerationService** - Used by FormGenerationAgent
- **LLM API services** - Reused for agent communication
- **State management** - Extended to handle conversation state

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Agent Services

1. **Prompt Analysis Agent**
   - Uses existing LLM API infrastructure
   - Analyzes prompts for completeness using structured output
   - Returns analysis with missing information categories
   - Integrates with existing `callLLMAPI` function

2. **Question Generation Agent**
   - Generates specific, actionable questions
   - Uses conversation context to avoid redundant questions
   - Follows existing system prompt patterns
   - Returns structured question objects

3. **Conversation Manager**
   - Manages conversation state and history
   - Tracks user responses and context
   - Determines when to proceed to form generation
   - Integrates with existing session management

### Phase 2: UI Components

1. **Agent Conversation Interface**
   - Chat-like interface for agent interaction
   - Question cards with input fields
   - Conversation history display
   - Seamless transition to form generation

2. **Enhanced Prompt Input**
   - Integrates agent conversation flow
   - Maintains existing functionality
   - Adds agent analysis and question flow
   - Preserves current UX patterns

### Phase 3: Form Generation Agent

1. **Form Generation Task**
   - Wraps existing `FormGenerationService`
   - Uses current system prompt and JSON schema
   - Maintains existing validation and error handling
   - Integrates with session management

2. **Agent Task Orchestration**
   - Coordinates between analysis, questions, and generation
   - Manages conversation flow
   - Handles edge cases and errors
   - Provides fallback to direct generation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Service Architecture

```typescript
// Core agent interfaces
interface PromptAnalysis {
  isComplete: boolean;
  missingCategories: string[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
}

interface AgentQuestion {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  category: string;
  inputType: 'text' | 'select' | 'multiselect';
  options?: string[];
  required: boolean;
}

interface ConversationState {
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  currentQuestions: AgentQuestion[];
  context: Record<string, any>;
  isComplete: boolean;
}
```

### Integration with Existing Services

The agent system will leverage existing infrastructure:
- **LLM API**: Reuse `callLLMAPI` for agent communication
- **System Prompts**: Extend existing prompt patterns for agent tasks
- **State Management**: Integrate with `AppStateManager`
- **Session Management**: Use existing `FormSessionService`

### UI/UX Considerations

1. **Seamless Integration**: Agent flow appears as natural extension of current interface
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Questions appear contextually without overwhelming user
3. **Fallback Options**: Users can always skip to direct form generation
4. **Conversation History**: Clear timeline of agent interaction
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

## Benefits

1. **Improved Form Quality**: More complete forms through guided input
2. **Better User Experience**: Guided assistance for complex forms
3. **Reduced Iterations**: Fewer back-and-forth cycles with generated forms
4. **Educational Value**: Users learn what makes good form prompts
5. **Maintainable**: Built on existing architecture and patterns

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Core Services): 2-3 days
- **Phase 2** (UI Components): 2-3 days  
- **Phase 3** (Integration & Testing): 1-2 days
- **Total**: 5-8 days

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Form Generation**: `FormGenerationService` handles prompt-to-form conversion
- **LLM Integration**: `callLLMAPI` provides unified API access
- **System Prompts**: Comprehensive prompts in `system-prompt.ts`
- **UI Schema**: Well-defined JSON schema for form structure
- **State Management**: `AppStateManager` handles application state
- **Session Management**: `FormSessionService` manages form sessions

### Key Integration Points
- **InitialPromptInput**: Main entry point for user prompts
- **FormGenerationService**: Core form generation logic
- **LLM API Services**: Communication with AI models
- **UI Components**: React components following atomic design
- **Type System**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Service Architecture**: Class-based services with clear interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **State Management**: Centralized state with React hooks
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with molecules and organisms
- **API Integration**: Unified API layer with configuration management

This plan maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while adding powerful agent capabilities that will significantly improve the user experience and form generation quality.

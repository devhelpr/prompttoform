# We use clean-code principles and atomic design

- Put business logic in classes
- Split components according to atomic design
- Keep components small and use react hooks
- Put functions and classes in separate files in a proper folder structure
- use kebab-case for filenames
- use interface and types and put these in separate files , reuse were possible

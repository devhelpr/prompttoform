# We use clean-code principles and atomic design

- follow SOLID principles
- Put business logic in classes
- Split components according to atomic design
- Keep components small and use react hooks
- Put functions and classes in separate files in a proper folder structure
- use kebab-case for filenames
- use interface and types and put these in separate files , reuse were possible
- DONT use inline styles, use tailwind classes instead
- use modern web-api's like dialog elements, etc.
- playwright tests for debugging are in the playwright-tests folder

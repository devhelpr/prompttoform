# react-forms

React Forms is a library for building forms with React.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-forms
```

## Usage

<FormRenderer formJson={...} />

FormJson is a JSON object that follows the https://prompttoform.ai/schema/v0.1/schema.json schema. Forms can be generated with the https://app.prompttoform.ai

Another requirement is currently tailwindcss.

If you use tailwind v4, then you need this in your main css file:
@source "../node_modules/@devhelpr/react-forms";
